        Because you are no longer tethered to a car that is in a parking lot, it
        opens up a world of dynamic movement that you will soon appreciate. It
        will completely change how you move around Miami.

        You can now go to a restaurant, then decide to go for a long walk and
        not have to worry about going back to a parking garage because at any
        point in time, you can hail an Ultra Luxury A1 naire vehicle to meet you
        at your current location.
