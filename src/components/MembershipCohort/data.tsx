          We will soft launch by the end of Q1 2024. During our soft launch, we
          will accept only 10 Members who will earn equity for helping us fine
          tune our service. Below are some key things to note during our soft
          launch.

          Pilots may still be going through training with regards to some of the
          advanced features of these Ultra-Luxury vehicles. We also will be fine
          tuning the high end dress code of our Pilots which you will have input
          in.

          We will still be scaling out our fleet. We will start with the
          Rolls-Royce Phantom, Rolls-Royce Dawn, Mercedes Maybach and the
          Ferrari GTC4 Lusso or 488 Spider. We then expand to the Range Rover SV
          and the whole Bentley and Rolls-Royce Family. Our first rare addition
          will be the Virgil Abloh Maybach. We will consider sports cars like
          the Bugatti and the LaFerrari based on feedback from our early
          adopters.

        <p>
          A1naire membership is $10,000 per month, giving you unlimited access
          to at least 15 ultra-luxury vehicle models and over 100 unique car
          experiences once we are fully scaled out. There is also a per ride fee
          that ranges from $300 to $750 based on factors such as distance
          traveled. Beyond early adopters, we will be accepting only 990 more
          members in Miami.

          The first 10 members to reserve will be gifted 50,000 shares in
          A1naire. Each member can earn up to 50,000 more shares based on how
          much they use the service through their first 3 months as a member. It
          is simple. If a member averages using A1 naire at least 6 times per
          week over their first 3 months as a member, they will earn 50,000
          additional shares. If they don't, the additional shares they will earn
          will be their total number of rides divided by 72 and then multiplied
          by 10,000. Thus, each of the first 10 members has a chance to earn a
          total of 100,000 shares which currently equates to 1% ownership of the
          company. Our goal is to make A1naire a $100 billion+ company once we
          reach operations in 30 cities worldwide. This means this 1% equity
          could soon be worth over $1 billion.
